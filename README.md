# SQL Directory
Database Design and Development | Project

I want to create a database that hosts everything that is necessary to create a directory. The
purpose is to store various details about a person; some of the information that the database will hold are first name,
last name, age, place of birth (country, state, street, etc), place of residence (country, state, street,
etc), religious affiliation, job / specialty, roles, personal contact information (cell phone number, email, etc).
